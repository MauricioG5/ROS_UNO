# ROS_UNO

## DESCRIPTION


This package contains ROS nodes from A to H wich post and subscribe different type of variables including Bool, Int16, FLoat32, Char and String.
Finally, there is a Node with a serial comunication between ROS and Arduno for real world implementation (H -> ARDUINO, ARDUINO -> A), these ROS nodes are intended to use a Fuzzy logic controller to consider 3 signals and make a decision for a final actuator.

- A NOde: Takes a String from Arduino and substract from it the value of each sensor. Publish each value on a differen topic: Bool, Int16 and Float32  
- B NOde: 
- C NOde: 
- D NOde: 
- E NOde: 
- F NOde: 
- G NOde: 
- H NOde:
